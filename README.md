# Cursorless Command Helper

## Usage

You'll need a Google AI Studio API key. We're using this instead of OpenAI or Anthropic because unlike those it has a free model that is more than sufficient, so there is no need to set up billing.
You can get one here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
If you run it locally you're free to experiment with different models. In my experience, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental works great, so anything better than that should work too, though I haven't tried.
